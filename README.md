# Derek Dhammaloka's Bootstrap Experience (Version 3.3.7)

Welcome to My Bootstrap Experience.  The purpose of this project is to investigate my experiences of Bootstrap (e.g. Jumbotron).

## UX

The aim is to provide you (the user) about my experiences of Bootstrap.  This includes styling
(e.g. the jumbotron has a background colour of pink).

Information Architecture - Computing, Karaoke, Holidays, Balls, jQueryDemo and Celebrities.  Organising Principle is Interests.

There is a keypad, which displays the name of a secretary.  The secretaries are Anna (index 0),
Daphne (index 1), Debbie (index 2), Cindy (index 3), Gayle (index 4), Sara (index 5), Victoria (index 6),
Stella (index 7), Rebecca (index 8) and Mary (index 9).  The names of the secretaries are entirely fictional.
The first load of the keypad display is *Select A Secretary* and its background color is lightblue.  

The background colors on the display are lightblue (index 0), lightgreen (index 1), pink (index 2), yellow (index 3),
wheat (index 4), orangered (index 5), lightgrey (index 6), #F5DF4D (illuminating, index 7) and #EC9787 (blooming dahlia, index 8).

The keypad has the numbers 0-9, C and S.  Background color is black.  All keys have
a color of white, except C (which is deepskyblue) and S (which is orange).

Hovering over the keypad changes the background color to navy, except C (which changes the background color to green)
and S (which changes the background color to purple).  Hovering over the keypad gives a tooltip (e.g. Select Gayle,
when 4 is hovered).

The keypad C is Clear.  The keypad S changes the background colors in the display.
